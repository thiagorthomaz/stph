# stph
STPH is a PHP web application framework for users who want to make code strongly-typed, like C# and Java. I'm starting this project because I need do my TCC (Final paper) - lato sensu in Software Engineering at University Positivo. My objective for this PHP framework are practice my skill in PHP language and do something to help others developers.
